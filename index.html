            <p>"Programming is how you get computers to solve problems."</p>
            <p>There are two key phrases here which are important:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You: without the programmer (you), the computer is useless. 
                    It does what you tell it to do.</li>
                <li>Solve problems: computers are tools. They are complex tools, admittedly, 
                    but they are not mysterious or magical: they exist to make tasks easier.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Computer programs (or software) are what make computers work. 
                Without software, modern computers are just complicated machines for 
                turning electricity into heat. It’s software on your computer that runs 
                your operating system, browser, email, games, movie player 
                – just about everything.</p>
            <p>Programming is a creative task: there is no right or wrong way to solve a problem, 
                in the same way that there is no right or wrong way to paint a picture. 
                There are choices to be made, and one way may seem better than another, but that 
                doesn’t mean the other is wrong! With the right skills and experience, a programmer 
                can craft software to solve an unlimited number of problems – from telling you when 
                your next train will arrive to playing your favourite music. 
                The possibilities are constrained only by your imagination. </p>
            <p>When you create a program for a computer, you give it a set of instructions, which it 
                will run one at a time in order, precisely as given. If you told a computer to jump 
                off a cliff, it would!</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Turn and face the cliff</li>
                    <li>Walk towards the cliff</li>
                    <li>Stop at the edge of the cliff</li>
                    <li>Jump off the cliff</li>
                </ol>
            <p>These three concepts are the basic logical structures in computer programming:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sequence: running instructions in order</li>
                    <li>Selection: making choices</li>
                    <li>Repetition: doing the same thing more than once</li>
                </ol>
            <p>Add to these concepts the ability to deal with inputs and outputs and to store data, 
                and you have the tools to solve the majority of all computing problems.</p>

        <header>Low-Level vs. High-Level Programming Languages</header>
        <article>
            <p>Programming languages fall into two different classifications — low-level and high-level.
                Unfortunately, computers don’t understand languages like English or Spanish, 
                so we have to use a programming language they understand to give them instructions.</p>
            <p>Low-level programming languages are closer to machine code, or binary. Therefore, 
                they’re more difficult for humans to read (although they’re still easier to understand 
                than 1s and 0s). The benefit of low-level languages is that they’re fast and offer 
                precise control over how the computer will function.</p>
            <p>
                High-level programming languages are closer to how humans communicate. High-level 
                languages use words (like object, order, run, class, request, etc.) that are closer to 
                the words we use in our everyday lives. This means they’re easier to program in than 
                low-level programming languages, although they do take more time to translate into 
                machine code for the computer.</p>
            <p>
                There are many different programming languages, all of which have their own merits, 
                and certain languages are better suited to particular types of task, but there is no 
                one language which is the ‘best’.</p>

        <header>Most popular programming languages</header>
        <article>
            <p>There are tons of programming languages out there that allow you to do all sorts of 
                things, from building virtual reality experiences to creating video games and more.</p>
            <p>The most popular programming languages include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python: Python is a versatile, general-purpose programming language. It can be 
                        used in a variety of fields from data science and machine learning to web 
                        development and is a great first language to learn.</li>
                        <p>This is a code example:<br>
                            <code>print("Hello and welcome.") <br>
                                name = input("Whats your name?") <br>
                                if name == "Martin": <br>
                                    print("Thats my name too!") <br>
                                print("Hi " + name) <br>
                            </code>
                        </p>
                    <li>Java: Another language that’s great when you’re starting out, Java can be used 
                        for many things, including mobile applications, software development, and large 
                        systems development. AP Computer Science is currently taught in Java.</li>
                        <p>This is a code example:<br>
                            <code>public class Maths { <br>
                                public int Add (int num1, int num2)<br>
                                {<br>
                                return num1 + num2;<br>
                                }<br>
                                public int Subtract (int num1, int num2)<br>
                                {<br>
                                return num1 - num2;<br>
                                }<br>
                                public int Multiply (int num1, int num2)<br>
                                {<br>
                                return num1 * num2;<br>
                                }<br>
                                public int Divide (int num1, int num2)<br>
                                {<br>
                                return num1 / num2;<br>
                                }<br>
                                }<br></code>
                        </p>
                    <li>JavaScript: JavaScript is a front-end and back-end friendly language that enables 
                        web applications, game development, and mobile applications.</li>
                        <p>This is a code example:<br>
                            <code>
